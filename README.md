# About:
This bot automatically posts messages for the game Warframe. It will handle events for the platforms `pc, xb1, ps4`. It can also create and mention roles when an alert or invasion with a certain reward appears. It will only post alerts as they appear. That means when you initially set it up, there will be nothing until one occurrs. Invasions and alerts will be updated over time and will be deleted when they expire.
