Update version of my Discord Warframe bot. OO and ES6 compliant.

Posts alerts and invasions to any channel named "wf_alerts", deletes messages when the events expire, updates invasion status every 10 minutes or so. I would write to a JSON to store guild + channel IDs but Heroku doesn't allow that. Also has several commands:

* help - standard help command
* notify - join or leave roles
* rolesetup - create the necessary roles for alert notifications
* baro - baro ki'teer info
* sorties - sortie info
* search - search datamined info
* about - links to the github page (here)
