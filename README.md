Update version of my Discord Warframe bot. OO and ES6 compliant.

Posts alerts and invasions to any channel named "wf_alerts", deletes messages when the events expire, updates invasion status every 10 minutes or so. I would write to a JSON to store guild + channel IDs but Heroku doesn't allow that. Also has a command to search loaded JSON files that contains datamined information. Not much else at the moment.
